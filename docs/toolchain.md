# Tools

cables uses the following tools for developing, building, deploying:

- `javascript/ecmascript` as a main language
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for dependency management
  - `npm run build` and `npm run start` are the main commands used
- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) for running [shell-scripts](./howto_helper_scripts.md) (mostly helper-script to update/install everything)
- [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for running the build scripts
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to package bundles to use in other parts of the project
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for linting code in editors
- [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) to pack and distribute cables standalone
- several other open-source [tools and libraries](https://cables.gl/support), to get things done
