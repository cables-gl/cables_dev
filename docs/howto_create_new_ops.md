# How to create new Ops

- Correct namespace / e.g. `Ops.Gl.TextureEffects.Blur`
- Changelog has been updated with correct op name and one line summary / new op : `Ops.Gl.TextureEffects.Blur - blurs a texture `
- Make sure the op has full documentation, it doesn't matter if it seems obvious what a parameter does its parameters should all be documented.
- Make sure the op has an example patch. Go to the op page, edit the documentation and put in the short-id of the example patch.
- Make sure the author name is correct.
